Obstacle_Avoidance_Multirotor
=============================
Codes are still under developement

Use Obstr_p_IR or Sonar files for indoor and outdoor operations.
Currently we will be using Propotional system for collision avidance.
PID is still under test.
I recommend using maxsonar for outdoor operations.
In NAZA or APM or PixHawk use with GPS attitude or position hold mode for best results in outdoor.




free repo please give credit if you use the code Thanks.
